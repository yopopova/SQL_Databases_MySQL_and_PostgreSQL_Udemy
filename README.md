# SQL Databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL) | Udemy

SQL is a standardized language and therefore learning SQL will help you apply it in all kinds of contexts. Nonetheless, different database systems also support different aspects of SQL or bring their own variations of the SQL language. Therefore, this course dives into SQL by exploring all key features at the example of the two most popular database systems: MySQL and PostgreSQL. All query and command examples are shown for both database systems, ensuring that you feel comfortable working with SQL in either environment!
